                The most recent product innovation was the introduction of the
                Non-Dairy vegan ice cream in mid-2023 targeted to the growing
                lactose intolerant community in the country and region. The
                digital campaign dubbed Dairy- Free Dream won an accolade at the
                MSK Awards for the Best Digital campaign of 2023. We partnered
                with Java on a digital campaign to launch the first ever vegan
                milkshake menu which is currently available in over 10 Java
                branches which is a big step towards ensuring inclusivity within
                quick service restaurants and beyond.
